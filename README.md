# A template for [SolidJS](https://github.com/solidjs/solid) (streaming) SSR with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) & [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).

_Based on my [SolidJS-TailwindCSS-Animate.css](https://github.com/godbleak/SolidJS-TailwindCSS-Animate.css) template_

This is the template I use to create SSR apps with SolidJS. It uses Vite to give you HMR in development, and Rollup for your production build.
I use TailwindCSS in most of my projects, so it's included here too.

## Setup

You probably don't need to be told this, but in case you forgot how to Node: clone the repo (or use the "Use this template" button), and then run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Usage

### Development

- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server, your app will be available at http://localhost:3000.
- Make epic shit.

### Production

- Run `npm run build` to build your app for production. By default, the output will be in the `dist` folder.
- Run `npm start` to start the server in production mode.

### Clean up

- Run `npm run clean` to remove the `dist` folder.

## Supporting

If you find this template helpful, consider petting a cat. They're often more appreciative than users. üê±
